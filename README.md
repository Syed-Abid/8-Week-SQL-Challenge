## Danny's Diner Case Study
- Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: 
  sushi, curry and ramen.
- Danny’s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea 
  how to use their data to help them run the business.
- Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are 
  their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.
